I am taking Spanish classes for two weeks while I am here in Caracas. The school is in Plaza Venezuela, a pretty busy commercial area of the city. This is the view from my class on the 19th floor. This is a pretty typical view of the city (facing south), heavy traffic, buildings sprawling up the hillsides and some type of construction going on.
I will try to get a shot facing north, of El Ávila. It’s a gigantic verdant mountain that towers over the city. It’s the signature feature of the city and since it’s a national park there are no building on it. It’s beautiful.
