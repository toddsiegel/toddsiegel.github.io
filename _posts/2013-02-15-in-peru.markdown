Last Sunday night I arrived in Lima and met Sharon at the airport. We spent only two days and that was enough. It’s a nice city, but it’s a city, so we took an overnight bus to Huaraz in the Cordillera Blanca in the Andes. Tomorrow morning we are doing a four day trek though the mountains. Hopefully I’ll have more pictures to upload that has been a problem thus far due to various technical difficulties in Internet cafes. I have a ton more from Venezuela to upload, which I will so as soon as I get a decent Internet connection.
